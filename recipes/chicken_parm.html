    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (16 oz) package skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>4 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a baking pan with cooking spray.
            Place chicken on the prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes.
            Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with
            mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the
            juices run clear, about 12 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
